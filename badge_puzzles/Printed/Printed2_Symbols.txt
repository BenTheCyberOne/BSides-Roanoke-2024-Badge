"Symbols" is located near the bottom of the back of the badge, under the battery pack.

1. These symbols don't look random, and are unique except for one character which is repeated 3 times. This might tell us they are substituted for a human readable string

2. Time to do some googling! Let's try searching for:
weird symbol cipher
symbols fonts
symbols ctf
cryptography weird symbol cipher

3. We should stumble upon the "Wingdings" font - used almost exclusivly for Microsoft to display symbols instead of letters. Look up a translator or pull up the direct character mapping and we can easily decode the symbols into readable text!
