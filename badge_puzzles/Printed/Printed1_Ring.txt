"Ring" is located at the top lefthand side of the front of the badge. These character patterns may look weirdly familiar to those who have participated in CTFs before.

1. The "Ring" is unspun is as follows: P1le_4pmslb_rf3_P0R

2. Ring = Circle = Rotation (ROT)

3. Attempting to use the classic ROT13 (caesar cipher) does not appear to show anything of use (ROT13{P1le_4pmslb_rf3_P0R} = C1yr_4czfyo_es3_C0E). Let's try starting from ROT1 and incrementing until we find something!

ROT1{P1le_4pmslb_rf3_P0R} = Q1mf_4qntmc_sg3_Q0S
ROT2{P1le_4pmslb_rf3_P0R} = R1ng_4round_th3_R0T

ROT2 gave us some fitting text!

Flag: R1ng_4round_th3_R0T
