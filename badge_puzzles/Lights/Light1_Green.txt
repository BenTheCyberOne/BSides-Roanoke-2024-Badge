Light Puzzle 1 "Green" is the first puzzle shown in Puzzle Mode.

1. Watch all of Puzzle 1 play out. We know it ends when the NeoPixels stop being green. Notice any familiar patterns?

2. Just like how you got to Puzzle Mode using the onboard button, "Green" is a flag being flashed in Morse Code. This can be seen with all 6 lights flashing in a longer or shorter pattern. It may help to record this pattern to slowdown the playback if it goes too fast for you.

3. Transcribed, the pattern is as follows: ..-. .-.. .--.-. ... .... .---- -. --. ..--.- .-.. .. --. .... - .....

4. Decode that, and we get the flag!
